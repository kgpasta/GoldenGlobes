# GoldenGlobes

EECS 337: Golden Globes Project

Text UI instructions:

nominees (award) - prints nominees for given award

Result files:

Results2013.json - 2013

Results2015.json - 2015

jokeout.txt - Funniest jokes

In order to make it adaptable for future years, we looked to a couple things

1. Looking at thresholds instead of numbers for jokes and for award winners, so that we can figure out answers no matter the data

2. Making sure that all of our formats for importing data are consistent, so that it will be easier to use other data sets
